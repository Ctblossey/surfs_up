# Surfs Up

## Overview

### Given a SQLite file, we needed to filter out the measurements table to get the temperature information. Once the information was gathered, it was converted to a list and then to a DataFrame. It was important to create a baseline code that we could copy and use for other months.

## Results

### - There were roughly 2,000 more temperatures in June than December.

### - June's mean temperature was roughly 4 degrees higher than December's

### - June's max temperature was only 2 degrees higher than December's

## Summary

### The two months that information was gathered for was surprising. Given that the months are in opposite seasons, only a difference of 4 degrees on average seems too close. Two additional queries I would do for June and December would be humidity % and amount of sunlight per day. These queries could provide more insight into the months and provide a reasoning for why the data is close together.
